# Studies reveal that the emission of methane gas in the Lixão do Aurá is equivalent to the burning of 34 thousand hectares of forest



**_Abstract:_** A group linked to the Incubation Project, of the Trópico em Movimento Interdisciplinary Program, measured the amount of greenhouse gases, especially methane gas, in the Aurá Lixão. Methane gas (CH₄), produced by the decomposition of organic matter, and very common in landfills and dumps, is the second most important anthropogenic component of the greenhouse effect. When compared to carbon dioxide (CO₂), it is more dangerous, since the same amount of CH₄ has 25 times more impact on global warming than CO₂.
