**_Summary:_** 	Urban solid waste in landfills and dumps represents an important anthropogenic source of Greenhouse Gases, mainly Methane (CH4), which has a high capacity to retain heat in the Atmosphere. This emission is influenced by factors such as waste composition, moisture content and age of waste, as well as site-specific factors such as regional climate and landfill management mode. In the literature there are few studies that estimate greenhouse gas emissions from landfills focusing on the Amazon region and its climatic characteristics. Therefore, this work aims to describe the dynamics of Methane gas emission at the Aurá Landfill, a place where, for decades, urban solid waste from the Metropolitan Region of Belém, state of Pará, was deposited and which is currently deactivated due to requirements. in environmental legislation. To this end, simulations were carried out using 1st order biogas emission models proposed by the IPCC and USEPA (LandGEM 3.02). The models were compared and variations in their main parameters were evaluated, as well as the influence of climatic conditions and waste characteristics on Methane emissions. Due to the high precipitation and humidity in the Amazon Region, it was observed that waste degrades quickly, making it necessary to take immediate decisions to apply emission control methods in landfills to prevent gases from escaping into the atmosphere.
