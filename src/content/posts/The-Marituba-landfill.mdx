**_Abstract:_** Urban Solid Waste in landfills and dumps is an important anthropogenic source of Greenhouse Gases, mainly Methane (CH4), which has a high capacity of retaining heat in the atmosphere. At the Marituba Solid Waste Processing and Processing Center (SWPPC) located in the Metropolitan Region of Belém, Pará, current and future methane generation from the year 2015 were estimated through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) model considering a minimum operation period of 15 years. The landfill will generate during its history approximately 610 thousand metric tons of CH4, of which approximately 95% will be produced in the coming years. Considering the global warming potential of methane that is 28 times higher than carbon dioxide (CO2) over the years, this will generate an amount equivalent to 17 million tons of carbon dioxide. The dispersion of methane gas as a tracer of other gases and odors generated at CPTR Marituba using a Gaussian dispersion model shows that at night time (18:00-06:00) gas accumulation is higher at the area surrounding the landfill and causes discomfort in the population, validating this information with the results of the interviews with the residents of the surrounding area of the municipalities of Ananindeua and Marituba, who suffer the greatest annoyances due to the bad odors in this same nocturnal period. The results of this research should be considered in the definition of public policies for the location of new landfills and in the implementation of actions to mitigate the negative impact of existing landfills. Despite the relevance of the topic addressed in this study, studies on the generation and dispersion of gases as well as the impact on the surrounding population in landfills in the Amazon Region are scarce in the literature, so this work will add to the understanding about landfills and its impacts on the Amazon as well as the use of biogas.
