# EMIT for the Future!
Since its July 14, 2022 launch to the space station, the EMIT hyperspectral visible/short-wave infrared sensor has been extremely useful!

## EMIT has the potential to revolutionize this field of remote sensing

EMIT incorporates multiple advanced new technologies. Its Dyson spectrometer optical layout provides exceptionally high photon throughput, meaning the optics maximize the light reaching the detector. The detector array uses new custom coatings to maximize sensitivity over the full EMIT wavelength range. Across EMITâ€™s 39-mile (72-kilometer) field of view, the instrument has a uniform spectral response. This allows use of the most advanced data processing algorithms.

## Applications
EMIT offers a diverse range of active applications that go beyond mapping greenhouse gases, snow properties and water resources. Its potential could extend to natural hazards, environmental pollution, coastal waters, harmful algal blooms, agricultural monitoring, forest and fire management, plant community and biodiversity monitoring. With the ability to support a wide range of environmental monitoring and management efforts, EMIT is a valuable tool for businesses and academics alike.

### Active Applications

#### Greenhouse gas mapping
Methane and carbon dioxide have distinct absorption features in the shortwave infrared (1800-2500nm) that permit the detection and mapping of point source greenhouse gas emissions with EMIT data.

#### Snow properties and water resources
 Despite this crucial role of the brightness (albedo) of snow, sparse measurements have kept us from understanding the global distribution of controls on snow albedo, grain size and radiative forcing by light-absorbing particles. In turn, this void has prevented us from accurately modeling cryosphere processes worldwide.
 > The accuracies required to understand the relative roles of changes in albedo and GHG radiative forcing in changing snow warming and melt require the spectral resolving capacity of the VSWIR imaging spectrometer.

### Potential Applications

#### Natural Hazards
EMIT data could enable detection of a variety of natural hazards and could be used to guide disaster management strategies.

#### Environmental pollution
Spectrometers like EMIT have been used to map oil extent from the deep water horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico, plastics in the environment, and to accelerate clean up of an acid mine superfund site in Leadville, CO.

#### Coastal waters and harmful algal blooms
 The EMIT sensor can be used to monitor ocean phytoplankton, harmful algal bloom biomass and composition, coral presence and bleaching events, and the health of coastal ecosystems.

 #### Agricultural monitoring
Crop health and agricultural production is essential to maintaining human health and societies. EMIT will collect data over many of the world's agricultural regions. Depending on the season and crop management, these data can provide information on crop types, vegetation health and disease, crop residue composition, and soil mineralogy.

#### Forest management & fire
Forest lands both in the western US and across the globe are at increasingly high risk of mortality from drought, beetle outbreaks, and wildfire. Data from EMIT could be used to monitor forest health through the water content of canopies, composition and dry biomass that make up fire fuels, and low risk areas where vegetation is absent, creating a nuanced perspective of fire risk across forest landscapes.

#### Vegetation community and biodiversity monitoring
Understanding the locations, distributions, and diversity of vegetation communities helps to promote good management and conservation efforts. EMIT data provide an opportunity to establish baseline maps of vegetation communities around the globe to help monitor ecosystem health, biodiversity loss, and conservation efforts. These maps could also be used to map the habitat of disease vectors, such as mosquitoes, to assist public health efforts to contain vector borne diseases.
