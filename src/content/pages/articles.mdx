## What's data about
EMIT is helping us identify the composition of Earth's surface and how mineral dust influences global warming now and in the future. 
EMIT is still acquiring data for its main mission, but it is also being used to detect plumes of methane and carbon dioxide from space, 
to directly address the sources of greenhouse gases that drive climate change. 

There are many other potential applications that EMIT could be used for in the future.

# Mission
Our mission is to bring a tool that enthusiasts, students and researchers can use to assist in searches and research with EMIT.

# Community
We also bring the possibility of sharing colabs notebooks, this incentive will help the EMIT research community to find helpers, thus opening the possibility of sharing, researching and publishing articles with the content studied.
