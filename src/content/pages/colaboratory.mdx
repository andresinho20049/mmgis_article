The EMIT  offers a diverse range of active applications that span beyond greenhouse gas mapping, snow properties, and water resources. Its potential could extend to natural hazards, environmental pollution, coastal waters, harmful algal blooms, agricultural monitoring, forest management and fire, vegetation community, and biodiversity monitoring. With the ability to support a wide array of environmental monitoring and management efforts, EMIT is a valuable tool for businesses and academics alike.
